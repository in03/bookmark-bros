Thank you for being such an amazing friend. 

Your kindness and support have meant (and continue to mean) the world to me. 

If it weren't for you, who knows when or if I'd have found the courage to step into the world of IT.

Thanks for your encouragement, wisdom, endless experience and the hangs. We've had plenty of laughs, and I'm sure we'll have more. 

I hope you enjoy these quirky bookmarks! Change as you wish haha.

PS: I'd check that AFOTY bookmark every now and again. You might just find you're on it someday 😉

With love and gratitude,
Caleb`,

You are our resident Network Ninja... 🥷

By day, you're catching high-school criminals on their hotspots and VPNs, also by day, you're doing pretty much everything else too! 

I've been so inspired watching you grow and serve. Your initiative and drive are truly remarkable – you see what needs to be done and you just do it 💪

I'm constantly amazed by how hard you work, always on the front-line! Grunt work or highly technical, you always go the extra mile. Your dedication is contagious! ⚡️

It's been a joy and inspiration watching you as a Dad. The way you love and care for your family is beautiful to witness. Your sons are lucky to have you 👦 👶

Most of all, I admire your servant heart and your love for worship. You bring such authenticity to everything you do. 

You have a beautiful voice and an anointed way of leading worship – may God continue to bless your time in His presence! 🎸 🪽 💨

I pray the very best for you and your family. May God continue to guide and bless you all.

With gratitude and prayers,
Caleb`,

Thanks for being Kiwi. And awesome. Well... same thing.

I wish I got to know you more before I left! The more I got to know you, the cooler you got: drones, rodeo, Warwick, NZ, lego, cold brew, CyberSecurity...

It's awesome that we're studying the same course. If you don't mind, I'll probably reach out and bug you every now and again. 

Maybe one day we'll work together again in Cyber hey? 😁

I know these mugs are cheap as chips and not worthy of a decent cold brew, but I hope you'll get someone to bug you about having a mocha every now and again 😂

Thanks again for the chats – we'll have to catch up sometime since you're just on the other side of Beenleigh!

P.S: Congrats on the citizenship! 👨🏻‍⚖️

All God's best,
Caleb`,

Thank you for being such a great colleague and friend. 

I've enjoyed our chats, jokes, and enduring exam logins, QCE and other IT duties together.

Thanks for teaching me SCCM and introducing me to PowerShell. You were a patient teacher and brilliantly thorough. I never could do it quite like you, but I appreciate that you trusted me with what you built over so many years.

I love your hustle for your family. You've saved and spent well, and now you're building them a house! Congratulations! (Proverbs 21:20)

I hope and pray the best for you – that HR will never contact you for a surprise meeting and that AI will never take your job 😅

I'll miss the amazing smell of your lunches and you inviting me to try your marketplace loot.

Praying all the best for you and your family,
Caleb`,
