Thank you for being such an amazing friend. 

Your kindness and support have meant (and continue to mean) the world to me. 

If it weren't for you, who knows when or if I'd have found the courage to step into the world of IT.

Thanks for your encouragement, wisdom, endless experience and the hangs. We've had plenty of laughs, and I'm sure we'll have more. 

I hope you enjoy these quirky bookmarks! Change as you wish haha.

With love and gratitude,
Caleb`,

Thanks for being Kiwi. And awesome. Well... same thing.

I wish I got to know you more before I left! The more I got to know you, the cooler you got: drones, rodeo, Warwick, NZ, lego, cold brew, CyberSecurity...

It's awesome that we're studying the same course. If you don't mind, I'll probably reach out and bug you every now and again. 

Maybe one day we'll work together again in Cyber hey? 😁

I know these mugs are cheap as chips and not worthy of a decent cold brew, but I hope you'll get someone to bug you about having a mocha every now and again 😂

Thanks again for the chats – we'll have to catch up sometime since you're just on the other side of Beenleigh!

All God's best,
Caleb`,
